## About:
This file contains the basic information for compiling the PDF by using the source code.

## Requirements:
Depending on the platform you use to write your paper, there will be different steps to follow. The requirements in each case are as detailed below.

### Unix-like distributions:
- `libcurl` version 7.81.0 or newer.
- `unzip` version 6.00 or newer.

### Windows:
- `PowerShell` in any version.

In addition, whichever operating system you use, you must have `TeX Live 2022` or newer installed. However, this requirement does not apply if you want to use the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) platform.

## Quick Start Guide:
Before generating the demo paper, you need to retrieve essential files from an external source. You can either manually download the files from the links in the `cen_config.ini` file and then unzip them into the `author_files` and `ciencia_e_natura_images` folders, or run a script provided in this repository. In this case a series of steps outlined in the `download-script.sh` or `download-script.ps1` files depending on your operating system.

Therefore, clone this repository and navigate to the `template_tex_ciencia_e_natura` folder afterwards.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:centraldeperiodicos/template_tex_ciencia_e_natura.git
$ cd template_tex_ciencia_e_natura
```
From this point on, follow the steps based on your operating system. For that, execute the commands below in either the terminal or command prompt in the root folder.

### Unix-like distributions:

For first-time use of the files in this project, it is necessary to turn the `download-script.sh` file executable.
```sh
$ chmod +x download-script.sh
```
Once done, run the script as shown:
```sh
$ ./download-script.sh
```

### Windows:
Just run the PowerShell this way:
```
$ PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./download-script.ps1
```
### Compiling the PDF:

For those working on local machines using any Operating System, use the following command to compile the PDF.
```
$ latexmk -pdf paper.tex
```
If you prefer to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com), upload all files from this repository along with the downloaded ones and compile the PDF using their platform's cloud service.

Whichever method you choose, if everything works well, the `paper.pdf` file will be available.
